description: A Rust repository is built and tested with Nix so that nothing is compiled twice.
dependencies: [knowledge:active-projects]
---

The working instance is github.com/LiGoldragon/rust-nix-example, built on github.com/LiGoldragon/build-base. Read it whole before changing a build; when this module and the example disagree, the example is fixed or this module is, in the same change.

## The unit of a build is the crate

Every crate, registry, git and workspace member alike, is its own derivation: crate2nix generates `Cargo.nix` from `Cargo.lock`, nixpkgs `buildRustCrate` builds each crate, and `Cargo.nix` is committed, so evaluation imports no derivation. An edit rebuilds the edited crate and the crates that depend on it, and nothing else.

```nix
{
  inputs.base.url = "github:LiGoldragon/build-base";   # nixpkgs, toolchain, crate overrides: one pin for all
  outputs = { self, base }: base.lib.workspaceOutputs { cargoNix = ./Cargo.nix; };
}
```

```sh
# after any edit to Cargo.toml or Cargo.lock, regenerate and commit Cargo.nix
nix run github:LiGoldragon/build-base#crate2nix -- generate
```

## One base, so a crate has one hash everywhere

Every active repository takes nixpkgs, the Rust toolchain and the crate overrides from build-base and pins none of its own. A crate at one version and one feature set then has one store path in every repository, built once on the remote builder and served to all. A native input a crate needs is added to build-base's overrides, never in a repository.

Build-base holds one version set for every crate a repository takes from another repository, `crate-versions.json` at its root, generated from the active repositories' locks: a registry crate by name and version, a git crate by name and version at one locked git revision (the full commit after `#` in the lock's source); two revisions of one version, or two semver-compatible versions of one git crate, are a misalignment. A workspace member, a path source, is in neither set. The `crate-versions` check in every repository's `checks.default` refuses a lock whose registry versions or git revisions depart from the set, naming each crate with its lock version (and revision) and the set's. Beside it, `crate-features.json` holds one feature set for every such crate, one per name and version, registry and git crate alike: the union of the features the active repositories resolve, applied by build-base's crate builder, so a crate at one version has one build everywhere. The `crate-features` check refuses a repository that resolves a feature outside the set or lacks a dependency the set pulls; that repository carries the edge itself, its dependency taking the feature in its manifest, lock and `Cargo.nix`. Nothing is held out of either set.

The same inputs are never compiled twice, and a feature is an input: a crate built with and without a feature is two inputs and two derivations, each built once, by right. A feature that differs by consumer becomes a crate wherever a crate can carry it: transport leaves signal as `signal-transport`. Where it cannot, the datom derives on the signal types being the one case, the registry lists each feature set the crate is built with, by name, as a deliberate entry, and the check refuses any set not listed; a second set exists only where a vision line places that feature per consumer, and the registry entry names that line (for datom, vision:ethos, "The datom traits are compiled in only where text is spoken").

A crate with named sets holds in `crate-features.json`, in place of its union, `{ "sets": [ { "name": "plain", "features": […], "attaches": […], "vision": "vision:ethos, …" }, { "name": "datom", … } ] }`, and every such crate lists the same names in the same order. A build, a member's, a test build, or one a flake composes through `buildRustCrateForPkgsFor { packageId; features; runTests; }`, takes the first name whose sets hold what it resolves for every crate with named sets, and every crate in it is built under that name, its set of the name or its union over dependencies built under the same name, so no build links two builds of one crate. The generator keeps the named sets as written and writes their `attaches`; it never adds a set, and refuses, writing nothing, where a member's resolutions are held by no one name, naming the member, the crates, their features and the listed sets, or where a crate's union passes a per-consumer feature on, which makes that crate take named sets too. The `crate-features` check refuses the same in a repository, and a Cargo.nix lacking an optional dependency that a set its member may be built with attaches.

A crate handed the same effective features is one derivation: build-base hands every crate `default` exactly where its features table declares it and every feature and optional dependency it implies is on, and drops it otherwise, so a crate with an empty `default`, reached with and without default features, is one build (`crate-default-features.nix`).

A version or revision bump happens once, in build-base: the sets are regenerated and every active repository follows in the same change.

```sh
# regenerate the sets from the active repositories; the version set refuses, writing nothing, where two locks disagree within one semver line of a crate or hold a git crate version at two revisions, naming each crate with its versions, revisions and repositories
nix run github:LiGoldragon/build-base#crate-version-set -- <Cargo.lock ...>
nix run github:LiGoldragon/build-base#crate-feature-set -- <Cargo.nix ...>   # also lists the edges a repository must carry
```

A repository's own flake, or a consumer of a repository on the base, takes `pkgs` from `base.lib.contexts.<system>.pkgs` and overrides none of the base's inputs (no `inputs.nixpkgs.follows`), so store paths stay shared.

## A Cargo.nix is proved current

`checks.cargo-nix`, in `checks.default` of every repository on the base, proves the committed `Cargo.nix` is what the base's crate2nix generates from the source: the lock's packages against `Cargo.nix`, then an offline regeneration compared byte for byte. `crate-hashes.json` is committed beside `Cargo.nix`, and `Cargo.nix` sits at the workspace root, generated with no flags; a `Cargo.nix` kept apart from its workspace is proved by `cargoNixCheck { source; cargoNix; crateHashes; }`, reached at `base.lib.contexts.<system>.cargoNixCheck` and handed to `extraChecks` with the rest of the build context; `source` is the workspace holding `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, and its `crate-hashes.json` is committed beside that `Cargo.nix`. A repository's own checks join `checks.default` through `extraChecks`, so a green default is the whole gate:

```nix
outputs = { self, base }: base.lib.workspaceOutputs {
  cargoNix = ./Cargo.nix;
  extraChecks = { pkgs, workspace, ... }: { fmt = …; clippy = …; };   # names apart from members, cargo-nix and default
};
```

```nix
# a second, separate Cargo.nix joins checks.default the same way
extraChecks = { cargoNixCheck, ... }: {
  dependency-cargo-nix = cargoNixCheck {
    source = ./dependency;
    cargoNix = ./nix/dependency/Cargo.nix;
    crateHashes = ./nix/dependency/crate-hashes.json;
  };
};
```

## A check runs; it does not compile

A crate's tests compile once, with the crate, into test binaries. There is one check per crate, which runs those binaries and compiles nothing; a failing test fails it, and the default check is all of them. There is no check per test: a test is named in its code and proved by its crate's check. A crate builds from its source without what its build never reads: `tests/`, `benches/`, `examples/`, Markdown, `Cargo.lock`, `Cargo.nix`, `crate-hashes.json` and the flake files (build-base's `crate-source.nix`), a member and a git crate alike. Its test build alone reads the whole source, so an edit to a test rebuilds the test build alone, and two commits of a crate that differ only in those files are one source path and one build, whichever revision a lock names.

`nix flake check` saying "running 0 flake checks" means nothing was left to build; the gate's green is put on record by building `checks.default`.

## Where a build runs

A gate is evaluated and built on the remote builder itself: nix-fast-build `--remote` runs nix-eval-jobs there, builds every check there, one ssh build per check, and copies nothing back under `--no-download`. The local machine reads the flake's metadata, evaluates no crate2nix expression and compiles nothing, cargo included. The host's own declaration names which machine is the remote builder.

```sh
nix run github:Mic92/nix-fast-build -- --remote prometheus \
  --no-nom --no-download --eval-workers 1 \
  --flake 'git+file://<clone>?rev=<commit>#checks.x86_64-linux'
```

The gate builds `checks.<system>` whole, so a failing check is named by its own attribute beside `default`. Its exit is the result, and its end is waited on as an event: the command runs in the foreground, or in the background where its exit wakes the flow that started it. A failure ends the output with the failed attributes, each one's log above it:

```text
ERROR:nix_fast_build:BUILD: 10 successes, 2 failures
ERROR:nix_fast_build:Failed attributes: …#checks.x86_64-linux.example-number …#checks.x86_64-linux.default
```

A gate runs against the committed revision, `git+file://<clone>?rev=<commit>` or the remote URL, never a copied tree: a check that stamps `self.rev` gives another result on a copy, so a copy is another gate. A `git+file` revision is copied to the builder as its source store path; a remote URL is fetched by the builder itself.

A build whose result the local machine holds, such as a package it installs, is a plain `nix build`: the host declares the builder as an ssh-ng remote builder with no local build jobs, so evaluation is local, every derivation builds on the builder, and the result is copied back.

```sh
# /etc/nix/machines: ssh-ng://nix-ssh@prometheus.goldragon.criome x86_64-linux … ; max-jobs = 0
nix build 'git+file://<clone>?rev=<commit>#<package>'
```

## A pin names a published commit

A git dependency is pinned to a commit its remote has, and a published history is never rewritten; a build from the repository's remote URL proves it. A flake used as a test fixture is a locked input by its bare URL, its rev asserted at evaluation, never `builtins.getFlake` on a local path.

A git dependency under `[patch]` that points at a workspace crate resolves to that path crate in `Cargo.nix`.
