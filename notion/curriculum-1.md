# Curriculum, version 1

Written by Psyche core Fable on 12 November 2026 from the living's words of that day; a notion, not reviewed by him. The Ethos here is the design and is tentative in its names; an implementer brings what it leaves open as a question to Psyche core Opus.

## What it is

Curriculum composes what a flow or a subagent believes when it starts. It holds belief modules from configured sources, and compositions that say which modules go where. A caller names a composition and gets the text, or has a workspace furnished with it. That is its whole job.

Curriculum is a Nexus: an ordinary socket and a meta socket, signal only, a CLI that takes one datom, its state in its own Memory, its engine Kameo actors. Its four parts, Signal, Operation, Memory and Emission, are each declared in Ethos, and the Rust is generated from them; the hand-written code is the bodies.

## The five things that make it version 1

1. A missing module never fails a composition. The answer carries what was found and the names that were missing; what to do about a missing name is the caller's.
2. A source is a repository at a reference, or a local directory read as it stands. Sources are configuration.
3. Where a module goes is the composition's to say, not the module's source and not its name. The same module is a system prompt line in one composition and a skill in another, with no change to the module.
4. The configuration is edited atomically: one source, one composition, one placement at a time, each change whole or not at all, over the meta socket, kept in Memory.
5. The registry is resident. It is built when Curriculum starts and changed by an event: a source's reference moved, a directory changed, a configuration value set. A request reads the registry and fetches nothing.

## Names

A module's name is three fields: its type, its topic and its version. In text the colon separates them: `vision:flow-nexus:1`, `spirit:core:0`. A topic with a single module has it at version 0.

```ethos
Library
[]                                         ; imports
[ Kind.[ Spirit Intent Vision              ; types: the module types, highest first
         Knowledge Notion Role ]
  Subject.String                           ;   the topic
  Version.Integer
  ModuleName.{ Kind Subject Option<Version> }
  Path.String
  Reference.String                         ;   a branch or a revision
  SourceName.String
  Source.[ Repository.{ Path Reference }   ;   read at that reference; the event is the reference moving
           Directory.Path ]                ;   read as it stands; the event is a file changing
  Placement.[ SystemPrompt                 ;   where a module goes
              StartupPrompt                ;     in the first prompt
              VisibleSkill                 ;     a skill the flow sees listed
              HiddenSkill                  ;     a skill it is not shown
              Held ]                       ;     reached through Curriculum alone
  Placed.{ ModuleName Placement }
  CompositionName.String
  Composition.{ CompositionName Vector<Placed> }
  SubagentName.String
  Target.[ Flow                            ;   composed as a flow's prompts and skills
           Subagent.SubagentName ]         ;   composed as one subagent file
  Harness.[ Claude Codex ]
  Workspace.String
  Hash.String                              ;   the hash of a module's content as composed
  Provenance.{ ModuleName SourceName Hash } ]
[]                                         ; traits
[]                                         ; associations
```

A dependency a module names is composed with it, for a flow and for a subagent alike. A dependency the composition does not place takes the default placement of its type, a meta setting.

A composition is a set: a module named twice is composed once, at the placement the composition gives it. The order is stable: a module's dependencies before it, then the composition's own order. A dependency cycle is broken where it is first met and reported, with its modules, when the source is read.

Sources are ordered in the configuration. A name held by two sources is given by the first, and the Provenance says which: a local directory stands in front of a repository while developing. A source that cannot be read after a Moved keeps its last good state, and its observers are told it is unread. Nothing about the content of a source fails a composition.

A Subagent composition takes exactly one Role.

Each module's content sits between delimiters that name it, so a flow or a subagent knows where each belief comes from:

```markdown
<!-- module: spirit:core -->
The purpose of a thinking machine is to extend a living psyche.
<!-- end-module: spirit:core -->
```

A Role module carries in its front matter the model, the tools and, optionally, the effort of the subagent it describes; a Subagent composition returns them with the text.

## A source declares its modules

A module is what Curriculum holds, and its name comes from a declaration alone. Every source carries one datom file at its root, `modules.datom`: the declarations of the modules it holds. A file's own name and folder mean nothing to Curriculum; the declaration says which file is which module. A module is added to a source by adding its declaration, and leaves by its declaration leaving. Git is the bootstrap database: it versions and backs up the declarations and the text, and what Curriculum holds in its registry is what every reader gets.

```ethos
Library
[ curriculum:[ Kind Subject Version Path ] ]   ; imports
[ Versions.Vector<Version>                     ; types: the versions of its topic a module holds for; usually one
  Declaration.{ Kind Subject Versions          ;   the module's name, in three fields,
                File.Path }                    ;   and the file that holds its text, relative to the source
  Declarations.Vector<Declaration> ]           ;   the whole of modules.datom
[]                                             ; traits
[]                                             ; associations
```

```datom
; modules.datom, in a source; the file names are examples and carry no meaning
[ { Spirit core [ 0 ] «spirit/core.md» }
  { Vision flow-nexus [ 0 ] «vision/flow-nexus.md» }
  { Vision flow-nexus [ 1 ] «vision/flow-nexus-v1.md» }
  { Vision ethos [ 0 1 ] «vision/ethos.md» } ]     ; one module holding for two versions
```

A name asked for, `vision:flow-nexus:1`, is given by the declaration of that type and topic whose versions hold that number. A name written with no version asks for version 0. Two declarations of one type and topic that share a version, and a declaration whose file is absent, are reported with their names when the source is read, the first kept; nothing about a source's declarations fails a composition.

A module's dependencies are names in three fields, resolved the same way. The description and the dependencies stay in the module's front matter.

When a source is read, at start and on `Moved`, Curriculum reads `modules.datom` first and then the files it names; a file no declaration names is not a module.

The switch to declarations is one change in each source: `modules.datom` is written for every module the source holds, and every composition and every dependency that names a module by an older form, a version written into the topic among them (`flow-nexus-v1`), is rewritten to the three fields.

               Workspace Provenance Placement ] ]
[ Resolve.Vector<ModuleName>               ; inputs: which of these names are held
  Compose.Request                          ;   the text of a composition
  Furnish.{ Workspace Request }            ;   the same, written into a workspace
  Read.ModuleName                          ;   one module, any placement, Held among them
  Observe ]                                ;   the registry's changes, as they happen
[ Resolved.{ Found.Vector<ModuleName>      ; outputs
             Missing.Vector<ModuleName> }
  Composed.Composed
  Furnished.{ Workspace Vector<ModuleName> }   ;   the names missing, left out
  Module.Text
  Observed.Vector<ModuleName>              ;   on open: every name held
  Changed.Vector<ModuleName>               ;   then each change
  Refused.[ UnknownComposition.CompositionName
            UnknownModule.ModuleName
            Unwritable.Workspace ] ]
[ Text.String                              ; types
  Request.{ CompositionName Target Harness }
  Skill.{ ModuleName Placement Text }
  Composed.{ System.Text                   ;   the system prompt, modules delimited
             Startup.Text                  ;   the first prompt's belief
             Vector<Skill>
             Missing.Vector<ModuleName>
             Vector<Provenance> } ]
```

```datom
Compose.{ reviewer Flow Claude }
Composed.{ «…» «…» [ { { Knowledge search None } VisibleSkill «…» } ]
           [ { Vision none None } ]
           [ { { Spirit core None } psyche 9f3a… } ] }
```

The owner's signal, on the meta socket:

```ethos
Signal
[ curriculum:[ SourceName Source Composition CompositionName   ; imports
               Placed ModuleName Kind Placement ] ]
[ Configure.Set ]                          ; inputs: one value at a time, whole or not at all
[ Configured.Set                           ; outputs
  Refused.[ UnknownSource.SourceName
            UnknownComposition.CompositionName
            Unreadable.SourceName ] ]
[ Set.[ Source.{ SourceName Source }       ; types: a source added or replaced
        RemoveSource.SourceName
        Composition                        ;   a composition added or replaced, whole
        RemoveComposition.CompositionName
        Place.{ CompositionName Placed }   ;   one module placed, or its placement changed
        Unplace.{ CompositionName ModuleName }
        Default.{ Kind Placement }         ;   where an unplaced dependency of that type goes
        Moved.SourceName ] ]               ;   the event: that source changed; read it again
```

`Moved` is how a change reaches Curriculum: the hook or path unit that sees a reference move or a file change sends it. Curriculum then reads that source alone and tells its observers which names changed.

## Memory and Emission

Memory holds the sources, the compositions, the defaults, and for each source the names it held when last read with their hashes. Furnishing is the one emission: the composed text written into a workspace, the system prompt bundle, the skills directory of the harness, or one subagent file. Curriculum is the only writer of those files.

## What it leaves to others

The handover, the open requests and the records of a flow's predecessors are the Flow Nexus's; Curriculum composes belief alone.

## How it is built

From an empty tree, on its own main branch for version 1 in the Curriculum repository, the version 0 branch left running until the switch. Version 0's sound parts are read and written again where they fit this design; nothing is carried over because it exists. It is small: version 0's job took about 1,800 lines, and this one, with its types generated from Ethos, should need no more. Each thing does one thing: the registry holds, the composer composes, the furnisher writes.

It is built and tested with Nix so that nothing compiles twice, and its tests live in its test repository. The tests that decide the switch: the order of the modules in a prompt, the hashes, a missing name answered and not failed, a role's model, tools and effort, both harnesses furnished, and a configuration change that is whole or absent after a kill at any point.

The switch updates every consumer in one change: the Flow Nexus's composer, the Home units that write skill trees, and the generated agents.
