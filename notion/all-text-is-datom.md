description: The living's brainstorm, not yet ruled: every text a tool takes is datom, a CLI's configuration is a signal file written by one configurator, and signal is named as rkyv under fixed choices.

# All text is datom

Raw, from the living's words in the Psyche core Fable chat on 2026-11-09, held here until he rules.

## What he said

- No tool takes a non-datom argument: every text a CLI, a translator or a configurator receives is datom. The place name as a CLI argument goes; a faked home as a way to pick a place goes too.
- A CLI's configuration is a signal file, not a datom text file, so the CLI reads it with the rkyv it already has and holds no codec. Whatever writes that file is a translator, datom in and signal out.
- Every CLI's configuration is the same type, so one tool configures all CLIs; it may be given the Nexus's name, for the standard place of that CLI's configuration, or a path, for development and debugging; it reads a configuration back as datom as well as writing one.
- Signal is the word for the binary form everywhere, wire or disk; a Nexus's store stays Memory, written in signal. Signal is rkyv under fixed choices, and those choices are to be named once, since rkyv alone is not one format: endianness, alignment, validation on every read, the four-byte length prefix on a socket. He finds the name rkyv bad and wants ours, signal, to carry the settings.

## The shape Fable proposed in chat, unruled

```ethos
CliConfiguration.{ NexusName PlaceName }          ; the same type for every CLI; grows as CLIs gain options
Target.[ Standard.NexusName                       ; the standard place for that Nexus's CLI configuration
         Path.String ]                            ; any file, for development and debugging
Configure.[ Write.{ Target CliConfiguration }     ; datom in, signal file out
            Read.Target ]                         ; signal file in, datom out
```

```sh
nexus-cli-configure 'Write.{ Standard.flow { flow main } }'
nexus-cli-configure 'Read.Standard.flow'
{ flow main }
```

## Open

- How a tester reaches place `next` with no place argument and no second home. Fable leans to the configurator rewriting the standard file: one command points a capsule at `next`, another back.
- Where the standard configuration file lives, once a faked home is out.
- The line Opus landed in vision:nexus-v1 (psyche-belief 2c84339), configuration as a datom text file at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nexus/<nexus>.datom`, is superseded in format and maybe in path by this, once he rules.
